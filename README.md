# CIS308_Pilot_Project_UI
This is the capstone project for CIS308 and CIS406 classes at Bellevue University.
We tried to build the project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Java beans, JSP, JSP custom tag, and Oracle DB.
The images used in the project were available on the internet for download, and we don't own any copyright on those images.
The name of the company 'KU Electronic' is a fictitious company.
